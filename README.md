# Hodos

Rust graph generation and traversal framework that models dynamic and modular systems, where mechanical sampling is separated from business rules.

Policies can be composed at runtime to handle new constraints, making it suitable for real world applications like logistics, robotics, or game AI, where dynamic events and complex rules govern traversal decisions.
